# Lab 2 – ARTI 308 (Machine Learning)

## Dataset
Source: Kaggle – Students Performance Dataset  
Link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rabieelkharoua/students-performance-dataset  

Description:  
This dataset contains information about 2,392 high school students, including demographic information, study habits, parental support, extracurricular activities, and academic performance.

## Machine Learning Problem
Problem type: Classification  
Target variable: GradeClass  

## Problem Statement
The objective of this lab is to explore the dataset and prepare it for a machine learning task. The goal is to predict the grade category (GradeClass) of a student based on features such as age, gender, study time, absences, parental education and support, and extracurricular activities. This is a supervised learning classification problem.

## Methodology
The machine learning workflow used in this lab follows these steps:
1. Data collection (Kaggle dataset)  
2. Data loading  
3. Data preprocessing  
4. Train/test split  
5. Model training  
6. Evaluation and results
